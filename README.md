Caesar Cipher Game
Overview

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher game in Python. A Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This game allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages using this technique, providing an interactive way to learn about one of the most ancient encryption methods.
